built with my style in mind and using some of my favorite colors. I've always
liked a very aesthetically pleasing look of certain pages so I tried my hand at making
some thing that brings some joy to your using experice. Its a little bright but
I really enjoy it and hope you do as well. If you have any questions about the
page or about myself please shoot me an email with either the page in the

## Code description
This is a React appliction using bootstrap for the layout of the
page and custom css styling for the color and UI of the page. This page used the
react router npm package to handle the page swtiching and emailjs for handling

components to map out an array of data for the elements on the page.
